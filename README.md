# Pokémon Emerald

This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald which applies multiple quality of life improvements which I personally enjoy and would player Pokémon Emerald with.

It builds the following ROM:

* **pokeemerald.gba** `using agbcc`
* **pokeemerald_modern.gba** `using a modern compiler`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
